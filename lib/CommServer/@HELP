NAME
    CommServer -- thinobject application to manage radio communications

DESCRIPTION
    CommServer is an organization using the thinobject scheme of several
    classes with the goal of providing access to remote hosts using 
    FreeWave radios in point-to-point mode.

    The CommServer class itself is just a placeholder, and (currently, at
    least) is not intended to be instantiated.

CLASSES
    CommServer -- manage a :wq
 
    CommServer.RadioSite -- radio node with links to other sites
    CommServer.RadioBase -- radio node with access via Internet or other means
    CommServer.RadioLink -- contained in a site, represents links to another site
