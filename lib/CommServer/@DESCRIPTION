CommServer or DataSite/CommServer

The CommServer thinobject class implements a machine to manage calls
to remote devices using FreeWave data modem radios.

(NOTE: The CommServer should perhaps also support other types of
connections, e.g., through a local or remote serial port, cell phones,
etc., and that should be supported, but the current focus is on networks
of FreeWave radios.)

A CommServer object is assumed to contain 'sites' either directly or
in the _/ container.  Those sites may be either RadioSite types, which
must have a @radio attribute, or RadioBase types, which must have an
%ip2radio attribute or equivalent.

The CommServer.call method is used to make a query on a site while obeying
limits and conventions of the commserver class.  

(NOTE: Both the RadioSite and RadioBase class also have call methods,
but those are at a lower level, i.e., the CommServer's conventions are out
of their scope.  CommServer.call itself execs RadioSite.call, which in 
turn runs RadioBase.call in a shell or as a subprocess.  Users of the system
would be advised to use only the commserver object's call method, and not
the other ones.  See the @DESCRIPTION property in those classes.)
