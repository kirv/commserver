NAME
    CommServer/RadioBase -- thinobject to represent radio base station

DESCRIPTION
    The RadioBase data type represents a FreeWave radio (e.g., FGR series)
    which is accessible by some means.  The *call* method will check and
    manipulate the radio callbook, then initiate a call to a target radio
    node.

    RadioBase inherits from RadioSite, so that a base radio can also be
    reached from a different base through the radio network.

METHODS
    call
