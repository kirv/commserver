The commserver project aims to provide a thinobject application to manage
and call remotely located research data sites using FreeWave radios in 
point-to-point mode.

The current version of commserver has been in use for at least 2 years, 
probably 2-1/2 years or just under 3.  It is not, however, a thinobject
application, but rather an ordinary standalone app which assumes a 
particular structure for its input data.

That input data is vaguely thinobject-like, stored in dot-directories 
which shadow do-nothing files named for the sites, but actually does
not make use of the thinobject conventions at all.  A .query file in 
each site is assumed to contain all the data needed to contact a remote
site.
